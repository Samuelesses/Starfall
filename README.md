# Starfall

Starfall is a rhythm based game with a 3D type camera. You can move your view to an extent, you use your mouse to click stars that decrease in size overtime. Click the star before it shrinks to bank score, the earlier you hit it, the more score you earn.

## How To Play:

1. Download & Extract the zip folder.

2. Run 'Starfall.exe'!

## Inspiration:

OSU! was an inspiration for this project. I enjoyed playing OSU! but I wanted a more random, aim-trainer type feel. Which is where the 3D camera movement comes in and the randomness is introduced.
